train_test_split

random_state, RandomState instance or None, default=None, Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.

---

KNeighborsRegressor

n_neighbors, default=5, Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries.
weights{‘uniform’, ‘distance’} or callable, default=’uniform’, ‘uniform’ : uniform weights. All points in each neighborhood are weighted equally.


DecisionTreeRegressor

criterion{“mse”, “friedman_mse”, “mae”, “poisson”}, default=”mse”, The function to measure the quality of a split. 
min_samples_split, default=2, The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
max_depth, default=None, The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.
min_samples_leaf, default=1,    The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. 

AdaBoostRegressor

n_estimators, default=50, The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated. 
learning_rate, default=1, Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each regressor by learning_rate
loss{‘linear’, ‘square’, ‘exponential’}, default=’linear’, The loss function to use when updating the weights after each boosting iteration.

RandomForestRegressor

bootstrapbool, default=True, Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree.
max_depth, default=None, The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.
max_features{“auto”, “sqrt”, “log2”}, int or float, default=”auto”, The number of features to consider when looking for the best split
min_samples_leaf, default=1, The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
min_samples_split, default=2, The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
n_estimators, default=100, The number of trees in the forest.

GradientBoostingRegressor

n_estimators, default=100, The number of boosting stages to perform. 
learning_rate, default=0.1, Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by learning_rate
max_depth, default=3, Maximum depth of the individual regression estimators.
min_samples_leaf, default=1, The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
max_features{‘auto’, ‘sqrt’, ‘log2’}, int or float, default=None, The number of features to consider when looking for the best split

LGBMRegressor

num_leaves (int, optional (default=31)) – Maximum tree leaves for base learners.
learning_rate (float, optional (default=0.1)) – Boosting learning rate.
max_depth (int, optional (default=-1)) – Maximum tree depth for base learners, <=0 means no limit.
n_estimators (int, optional (default=100)) – Number of boosted trees to fit.
